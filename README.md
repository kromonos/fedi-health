# Mental health blocklists

## The Tier System

Tiers will reflect blocklist size, with higher tiers having larger blocklists and being based on an abuse score system.
The lower the tier, the higher the minimum abuse score needed to get on this list.

For example, Tier 0 contains only instances, with an abuse score higher than 2000 and can be considered the worst of
the worst. Tier 3 contains all instances, with an abuse score higher than 750 and should only be used, if you're very
easy to trigger, as Tier 3 is very restrictive.

You are encouraged to use these lists if you find them useful.

## What's The Purpose Here?

We see issues from the same servers, over and over again. Since most blocklists, which are led by demagogues, only
blocks based on personal grudges, this one is meant to create a safer space for people already struggling with mental
disorders, like PTSD, major depression, borderline, who don't want to get involved in a bitch fight of other instances.

This is our best guess of the kinds of blocks you might need to keep the fedi safe.  

## Default scores

The current default for the lists here is:

| Tier | Min. abuse score |
|-----:|-----------------:|
|    0 |             2000 |
|    1 |             1500 |
|    2 |             1000 |
|    3 |              750 |

## Where's the Receipts?

Not here. There is no reason to get into any fights about what is essentially a point-in-time *status report*.  
These are easily importable blocks that can be reviewed and opted out of individually. In a searchable format with a
static URL, they can also be used to drive other blocklist projects and become a trusted source for others to sync and
maintain their blocklists.  

If you need more details about an instance, feel free to use the search at the [BKA.li FediDB](https://l.bka.li/fedidb).

## Advantages

Unlike other known blocklists, in this one, instances that are no longer reachable are automatically removed. This means
that only very few instance cadavers are imported. Furthermore, we do not automatically include the main domain, but
only the domain that actually runs the ActivityPub compatible software!  
Anything else would be defamation, which we would **not join** in and will do better than other, well-known blocklists.

## Dual Hosting

The main repository is hosted with [GitLab](https://git.bka.li/kromonos/fedi-health) and mirrored from there to 
[GitHub](https://github.com/kromonos/fedi-health).
