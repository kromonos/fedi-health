# Mental health blocklists

## The Tier System

Tiers will reflect blocklist size, with higher tiers having larger blocklists and are based on an abuse score system.  
The lower the tier, the higher the minimum abuse score needed to get on this list.  
For example: Tier 0 contains only instances, with an abuse score higher than 2000. You can always take a look at
the [BKA.li FediDB](https://l.bka.li/fedidb) to see the scores.

You are encouraged to use these lists if you find them useful.

## What's The Purpose Here?

We see issues from the same servers, over and over again. Since most blocklists only blocks on base of personal grudge,
this one is meant to create a safer space for people already struggling with mental disorders, like PTSD,
major depression, borderline, and don't want to get part in a bitch fight of other instances.

This is our best-guess of the kinds of blocks you might need to keep the fedi weird *and* safe.  

## Default scores

The current default for the lists here is:

| Tier | Min. abuse score |
|-----:|-----------------:|
|    0 |             2000 |
|    1 |             1500 |
|    2 |             1000 |
|    3 |              750 |

## Where's the Receipts?

Not here. There is no reason to get into any fights about what is essentially a point-in-time *status report*.  
These are easily importable blocks that can be reviewed and opted out of individually. In a searchable format with a
static URL they can also be used to drive other blocklist projects and become a Trusted Source for
others in syncing up and maintaining their blocklists.  

If you need more details to an instance, feel free to use the search at the [BKA.li FediDB](https://l.bka.li/fedidb).
